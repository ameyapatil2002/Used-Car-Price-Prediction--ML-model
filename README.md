This project implements a system for predicting the price of used cars using the Random Forest Regression algorithm.

The system is designed to take in various features of a used car and predict its market value. 

# Key Features:-
Random Forest Regression: A robust machine learning algorithm known for handling complex relationships between features and the target variable (price).
Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning and feature engineering techniques are applied to prepare the data for modeling.

# Usage:-
1) Clone the repository
2) Run ("pip install -r requirements.txt") to install the required libraries.
3) Train the model using given test dataset.
4) Run python app.py to execute.
